                No meaning to be found here, or anywhere else but especially here. Things here either don't fit anywhere else because of organization
                or because what is written here is so utterly stupid. Thus no organization of the contents whatsoever.

                They say you should be humble to things you don't know much about. Small problem though, we as humans get really dunning-krugered
                with things (source myself) and thus can't know when to be humble in the first place. But you shall always be humble exclaims AP.
                Why should I have humility as my neutral/default stance? Sounds boring as hell. Also AP is lying.

                There is great irony in me telling any reader to go outside at the bottom of every pagewhen for the last couple of months the only thing
                I've done is staying inside and writing a stupid videogame, lacking any purpouse whatsoever. I've only went outside like once a day to
                exercise for a couple of hours so that I'm too tired to want to stand up for the rest of the day. Feeling like an absolute gremlin, pretty good.
