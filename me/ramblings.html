                No meaning to be found here, or anywhere else but especially here. Things here either don't fit anywhere else because of organization
                or because what is written here is so utterly stupid. Thus no organization of the contents whatsoever.

                There is great irony in me telling any reader to go outside at the bottom of every pagewhen for the last couple of months the only thing
                I've done is staying inside and writing a stupid videogame, lacking any purpouse whatsoever. I've only went outside like once a day to
                exercise for a couple of hours so that I'm too tired to want to stand up for the rest of the day. Feeling like an absolute gremlin, pretty good.
