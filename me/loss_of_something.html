                There is this wierd thing that happens sometimes.<br>
                It feels almost otherworldly. Like you leave your own body for a few seconds. You get this strange sensation of all muscles in
                your own body and can feel the moving of each and every one of them. But at the same time you almost fall to the ground by the shock
                incured upon you by this feeling.

                It used to happen often to me, when I was way younger. But almost as I've gotten used to existing this <i>experience</i> has begun
                to fade as a distant memory. As if existence has gotten hold of a curious mind and strangled it into docile acceptance of it's situation.
                And when it happens less and less, I feel as if the river of time accelerates me faster and faster. Not that I feel any fear of death
                or anything silly. But that what I do eventually experience becomes of lesser importance due to not having this to relate to.

                It's funny. I don't want this to stop happening. I try to fight it, as if loosing control like that is what makes me be.
                Although loosing control is probably the wrong phrasing. More like gaining absolute control, which feels like having none.
