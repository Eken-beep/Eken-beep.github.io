                <p>Pain</p>
                <p>Sometimes it feels good, sometimes not</p>
                <p>
                    Today I ran, not for very long, but as fast as I could manage. It is painful, anyone who tells you otherwise is either bad
                    at pushing themselves to their limit or a liar.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though it was painful, I enjoyed it, every last second. That is good pain, it makes me feel alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's not like I enjoy cutting myself or drinking acids or whatever, that is truly depressing. But sometimes it feels good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being sad is pain too, it is not harmful to anyone. Completely harmless. Why are we fighting it tooth an nail? Me included.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I know it is not real, I know my brain made it up. Or rather my lower consciousness made it up and my higher consciousness
                    has to suffer the consequences. It is assuring to know that, but does it ruin the enjoyable pain? Plausible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When someone else comes too close, metaphorically, I feel pain. Or when I come too close to someone else, I feel their pain.
                    But not always, sometimes you get close to someone else and the pain of being close is enjoyable too. That has happend,
                    however only sometimes when it is on my own terms, is uncontrollable pain the painful type?
                 </p>
                <p>
                    The worst type of pain is the pain others feel, you have even less control than over your own pain.
                    And unlike when it is with me, I can't be sure it is fake to them too like it is to me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inflicting pain on others also creates bad pain, very much so. Even though that is on my terms, most of the time.
                    That is weird, goes against what I thought.
                </p>
                <p>What would happen if we did not feel pain?</p>
                <p>I don't know, could I even distinguish between my bad and good feelings?</p>
                <p>Could I even feel something positive?</p>
                <p>
                    It is ironic that I fear a world without it.
                </p>
                <p>It can go away for a moment though.</p>
                <p>By laughing at it, it dissapears.</p>
                <p>By embracing it, you might enjoy it. At risk of being hurt by it.</p>
                <p>By rejecting it, it dissapears, while taking a piece of you with it.</p>
                <p>
                    So we will all go on
                </p>
                <p>
                    And yet, the world is as beatuiful afterwards. It has forgotten everything and forgiven everyone.
                </p>
                <p>Aaah what the hell.</p>
