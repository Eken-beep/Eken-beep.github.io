            <p>
                There is a fundamental contradiction I've found in my way of seeing the world
            </p>
            <p>
                I have such hate for authoritarian actions by the people in power. I desire freedom for myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yet I know what people do when they obtain this freedom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freedom of tax, the unfortunate now starve.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freedom of law, I will now be ravaged by crime.
            </p>
            <p>
                Freedom from shitty corporate practices, the companies now cease.
            </p>
            <p>
                But when not given these freedoms I feel the system is unjust. I feel as though everyone should have the right to decide for
                themselves what is right or wrong. But that does not lead to everyone treating everyone well, because
                people are <i>stupid</i>. I know I would treat everyone with respect even when given total freedom, or would I?
            </p>
            <p>
                My moral compass would tell me that giving others this freedom I desire is the only right I could do.
                Yet I would not want my peers to live with the consequences it gives.
            </p>
            <p>
                What if I could live in freedom, nay anarchy, but everyone else has to live under authority. But that does still not make this gut
                feeling I have go away, that I am doing someone wrong when not sharing my freedom with others. However I know they will be better of
                under authority than in freedom, I've seen it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will keep on living with this contradiction for know. Wishing for a better future.
            </p>
