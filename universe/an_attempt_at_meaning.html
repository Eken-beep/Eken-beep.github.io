                <h1>The meaning of all this</h1>
                <p>
                    Some might say the meaning of everything is something stupid like reproduction or "finding happiness" whatever that even means.
                    I don't like it when the answer is that simple, but neither do I agree with the fundamental idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As far as I'm concerend there literally is none, judging by the absurdity of our situation,
                    however much you ponder on it you wont get anywhere else no matter what tricks you try to pull to escape the existentialism.
                    But there is one thing that humans have done since our dawn that might get pretty close, namely exploring the world around us.
                    This also sounds pretty stupid as some answer to everything, but exploration is what has made us survive thus far so it makes sense
                    for us to value it especially.

                    Just look up at the sky, there you find the most beautiful shade of blue we will ever witness. The clouds possess the most intricate of shapes.
                    Go to a forest, the trees are all beautiful with vibrant shades of green. The flowers shaded by them in vibrant colors.
                    During winter the snow glimmers like gold in the low winter sun and looking closer you find natures most complex patterns in the palm of your hand
                    in snowflakes. And staring up at a star filled night sky is a new experience each time, with the universe always in the mood to show you
                    a new side of itself. Meanwhile in the deepest oceans lies places we can not even imagine from where we are right now.
                    Exploring the paradise we are presented with is not just a temptation, nay, it is a challenge. And god damn it if it is the only
                    thing we manage to do then let us find out what the surface of Mars <i>feels</i> like.

                    I am not a fan of all the billionares racing against each other for being the first to find the last place in our solar system.
                    If it is to be done it is to be done by a united effort where every last person is on board, because if this has anything to do
                    with something materialistic then there is literally no point to any of it. I belive that space exploration and other lofty goals are
                    equivalents to society's top layer on the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Only meaningful once all other layers are satisfied.
                    But many people are in need of some goal to unify them, exploration and discovery is merely one of them.
                    A goal for us all to rally around is important, but more important is that is does not come at expense of our freedom.
