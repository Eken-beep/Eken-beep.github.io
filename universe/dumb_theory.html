                <h1>My current little theory of everything, supported by nothing and no one</h1>
                <p>
                    I have one of those two, and starting with it feels fitting for this blog or whatever this even is supposed to be.
                    Anyone who knows anything about physics knows that there is an odd ammount of perfection to everything. The universe is so
                    perfect in fact, that something as complicated as time dilation can be proved with simple math and it works. This is an inherent beauty of our
                    universe but it should make anyone suspicious. Meanwhile there are still parts of it we have yet to understand and I am sceptical we ever will.
                    For example in a black hole or before the big bang all physics we know break down. On very small scales in the atoms the same thing happens,
                    I haven't kept up with the latest string theory but for all I know they are still stuck. Some might call this our limited knowledge but
                    for all we know it might just as well be god, the dude himself showing his fat ass in the cracks of his cage around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But there is one more thing we have yet to understand, our own mind. Of course a system can never understand itself with a birdseye perspective,
                    but there is still some parallell to be drawn here. My theory is that the universe exists solely in our heads, or a similarly structured system.
                    This is because for one we really like rationality so it makes sense that whatever we might fantasise into existence is made up of math.
                    But also that we are finding limits of it, a limited organism like a brain would show those cracks at some point.
                    I also subscribe to the theory of egocentric presentism, which means that there is also only one of those systems that made up this
                    entire escapade we call life. That would explain why reality is similar for every observer in it but egocentric presentism is a topic
                    for another discussion.
