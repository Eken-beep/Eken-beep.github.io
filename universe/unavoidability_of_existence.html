                <h1>The unavoidability of existence</h1>
                <p>
                    One thing I have found that I have beef with is the people who are thankful for being born or something like that.
                    This is stupid. One which has never been born is incapable of complaining about not existing. And one which is dead
                    is incapable of complaining about being dead. This is not me being ungrateful for being alive, more just going with the flow.
                    Existing sure is pretty nice but nobody would complain after the apocalypse has already happened would they.
                    This ties in to the sentiment of thanking some higher power when something goes your way. Theres no shot that if god
                    is sentient like us in some way, that he would give a flying fuck about whether you lost some football game or whatever
                    first world problems people pray to god about nowadays. But one thing is for sure, god does not care if he created you or not.
                    He probably has more important shit to do.
