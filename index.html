            <h3>Now what the hell is this?</h3>
            <p>
                Some people are really good at bothering others with their ideas, one thing is clear, nobody gives a shit.
                I am criminally guilty of this, to stop this I've created this site to scream into instead. Realistically though it won't change anything.
                And when I'm not screaming into this website I am excitedly talking to it about this new thing I did/learned.
                This exists both for my and my surrounding's mental well being. And the good part about it is that nobody even has to read it, I just
                imagine that someone does anyways.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal here, if I'm allowed to have one of those, is to be as honest as possible. I feel as though I need some place to be that on,
                and maybe yelling at cloud is when I am honest. Being honest is a noble pursuit, sure, but perhaps an impossible one. I hope this will
                be somewhat honest however or atleast as honest as I can get with myself, the first step towards a solution is awareness.
                The goal is not to be an overall more honest person, but to have one place I can be honest on for some unknown desire I have.
            </p>
