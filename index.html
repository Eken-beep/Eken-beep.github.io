                You seem to have found your way to my personal website, lucky you.
                <br>
                Here I collect <i>anything</i> that peaks my interest, from thoughts to random media.
            </p>

            <h3>Now what the hell is this?</h3>
            <p>
                Some people are really good at bothering others with their ideas, one thing is clear, nobody gives a shit.
                I am criminally guilty of this, to stop this I've created this site to scream into instead. Realistically though it won't change anything.
                And when I'm not screaming into this website I am excitedly talking to it about this new thing I did/learned.
                This exists both for my and my surrounding's mental well being. And the good part about it is that nobody even has to read it, I just
                imagine that someone does anyways.
