                I don't fucking know, how should I. Me even implying that I know the answer to that question makes me look ridiculous.
                How can you be so sure that you dare ask me such a binary question. Do you?

                Yes of course

                Aww, stop taking yourself so seriously all the time. And the atheists toooo. You are both so full of yourself that you can't imagine
                anything other than the human. For atheists they can't even think there is divinity in the first place and for christians or whatever
                the issue lies with you thinking some divine being is as retarded as us. God might be, but most likely he is so beyond our understanding
                that any attempts are doomed from the start.

                Do you seriously belive that whatever shit some dude made up about what this possible diety is like is correct.
                I mean you are probably more correct than the atheists who are so full of themselves that they belive we <i><b>will</b></i> find
                out everything there is to our universe. But still, it's stupid to assume you know something about something we inherently can't
                know anything about. You are going to die and one of two things will happen (granted "god" exists). 1) You go to be judged for your sins
                or something dumb and god has a little laugh at whatever stupid crap you belived about the dude just hours before and all the
                things you begged about. Or 2) which IMO is more likely, you die and are sent straight to hell no matter what you did because god
                is off doing some dumb shit and can't be bothered giving a fuck about every person that dies because there are millions each day.

                On the other hand, completely denying the existence of anything spiritual is also dumb. Even though we might never find out
                wether or not god exists, it is undeniably something about our own consciousness that reaches into that realm. I have a hard
                time beliving that we ourselves are purely materialistic in the atheist sense. We probably were not put here by god but
                just because evolution took some bacteria to humans does not mean that there is nothing spiritual about our existence.

            <p>
                I choose to view god not as some supreme being but a stand in for everything we don't understand. Once upon a time reproduction
                was viewed as god, then we learnt about biology and killed part of god. Nowadays we don't understand how to unite the theory of
                general relativity and quantum mechanics. We might solve that issue and thus kill yet another part of god. Or we might never solve
                that problem and let that part of god live as long as humanity does. It does not matter wether or not there is a dude in the sky.
                We know so little of it that it does not matter what we call god or what we make of it. If you're in a hurry to know then you can
                die whenever you want, the cat will die at the hand of curiosity yet again. But I have no plans to go to hell any earlier than
                I have to.
