                <h1>Perfectionism</h1>
                <p>
                    We always strive towards smoothing out every last irregularity in society.<br>
                    But what is there to grip on once we have created the flawless utopia?<br>
                    What injustice is there to judge our actions against once the last injustice has been erased?<br>
                    Will we inevitably fall into dystopia by creating a flawless world simply by sliding down the slippery slope?<br>
                    Of course i am not opposed to fighting against what you find is wrong, that is both positive and neccesary.
                    It is the people who think that everything will magically become better once this is reached who are delusional.
                    But that's all fine, even hoping to achive a society without injustice is futile as erasing one seems to just create more in many cases.
                    And possibly driving us into the gutter even further.

                    One interesting extension of this I have come across is our seemingly endless search for the pure soul, the one which can do no wrong.
                    Can we never accept that no person will ever be perfect, not physically nor morally? Cancel culture is the epitamy of this.
                    To immediately dissmiss someone in their entirety based on one wrongdoing is utopian thinking at best and ignorance at worst.
                    Because we can not just expect the people who cancel others to never have done anything wrong on par with what they cancelled someone
                    else for. Shitting on cancel culture turned this into milquetoast real quickly so I'll stop here.
