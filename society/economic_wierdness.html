                I have to make this half way a joke or otherwise I'll fall asleep writing it. (only like half tho)
                <h1>What even is the shit on my bank's app</h1>
                That's it, I am not even going to try to understand anything that has to do with economics anymore.
                <p>
                    I heard yesterday about all the different ways to calculate extreme poverty. Apparently depending on how you measure it you can
                    get so wildly different results that the entire measurement seems useless. The argentinian state measured extreme poverty at 6%
                    while defining it as something along the lines of not having enough money to buy food or have a roof over your head, sounds fair
                    enough right? Well the IMF said that according to it's definition which is $2.15/day of income, 0% of argentinians lived in extreme
                    poverty. How the hell does this even make sense, how can you define extreme poverty as anything but starving? And the line for extreme
                    poverty has apparently changed many times over too, it was $1.95 just a while ago but they changed it to $2.15. Why you ask?
                    No fucking clue, inflation perhaps? But inflation can't have been that big, also isn't that different between countries.
                    Because when I went to Switzerland, I needed way fewer of their little coins to buy stuff than I need here in Sweden.
                    Aditionally, I remember a time when the dollar cost 8 sek but now it costs like 10 or something, so it can't even be linear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At risk of sounding like a complete idiot, I mean I am because I know basically nothing about this stuff, I wonder what the
                    hell economists think they're doing. Can they just make whatever shit they want into a neat little graph to prove their point.
                    Or is it all some fucking voodoo us normies are to dumb to understand. I get one thing though, making a nice looking function
                    is unreasonably satisfying, one guy even made a car in desmos from just sine waves. But that's not science that's the math lessons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Henceforth I will be dubbing myself a capitalst mysticist. I will not even try to understand anything about economy.
                    If even the top economists<sup>TM</sup> have no clue what they're doing (or are just paid shills) then how am I supposed to
                    do my taxes?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>But muh market dynamics</q> exclaims AP<br>
                    Fuck that shit, I don't care. How did the municipal government decide my wage last time I worked there? Well in the best
                    case cenario they just pulled a wild ass guess based on vibes, but I recon they pulled out an ouija board or something
                    and communicated with the gods to find out what to compensate me with. Atleast when I do some voulonteer work and I get a
                    free dinner in return I understand what I just got. When I do "real work" and get paid some dumb number on my phone goes up,
                    I don't even know what happens when it reaches zero, do I get kicked in the nuts or something?
                </p>
                <h3>Speaking of gods</h3>
                <p>
                    I view economy alot like I do with divinity in general, which I speak about <a href="./religion.html">here</a>.
                    With a bit of contempt, a great deal of wooo factor and mild distrust for whatever they're trying to sell me on.
                    Because I can't prove whether or not god exists, but neither can I know wether the economy is even real.

                    They said on television that life bad because the line labeled inflation slightly rose. What does it even mean?
                    Sure the butter in the store is more expensive. But why doesn't line go up when the average house in Stockholm
                    costs more than 10 years of salary? Because some dude on the central bank decieded that apparently when houses
                    become expensive it does not count because vibes or something. But then there is the other line, the GDP line.
                    I can't even reason as to what that is supposed to mean. They say when that line goes up life is good.
                    Well I can't really tell. A couple years ago some truck driver crashed on a bridge here causing it to collapse.
                    Which in turn, lead to the GDP line going up. Collapsing a bridge does not equate life good in my book but
                    that could just be me.

                    I know one thing for sure though, I'll be sticking with math and physics for my daily dose of science.
                    They might be kept together by unicorn hair and ducktape at this point too. But then economics must
                    be kept together by just unicorn hair because there is nothing for any outside to grasp to for understanding.
