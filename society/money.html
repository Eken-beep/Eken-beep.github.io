                <p>
                    Advertising in it's current form might be one of the worst things we have created yet. It has gotten to a point where the internet is
                    completely unusable without using adblock (I'm hardly the first one to say so) and going to any public setting in densely populated areas
                    immediately gets you blasted with an infinite ammount of company messages all trying to do the same thing; convince you that you need their
                    worthless products and that you will forever be unhappy without them. The fact that you are trying so hard to get me to buy something I don't
                    need is absolutely disgusting and your attempts will only make me spite you more. But the thing I hate the most is that apparently it works
                    as two of the highest valued companies are entierly funded by such soulless advertisements. And people go out shopping for stuff just for fun
                    or to kill time, this is probably the part of shopping that makes advertising as a business go round as I can't imagine any planned purchase
                    being significantly impacted by an ad you've seen.
                    Thus is my duty to avoid anything and everything with advertising on it if i can't block them.

                <h3>And AI too you piece of shit</h3>
                <p>
                    The main <i>current thing</i> that everyone is trying to sell seems to be AI and I'm really sick of it. Now even the fucking vacuum cleaners
                    need to be powered by AI technology<sup>TM</sup>. And we are all collectively so susceptible to their stupid marketing that all of a sudden
                    everyone belives that the machine has awoken and that the supreme intelligence is now on a slow march towards taking every last one of our
                    jobs (and knows all questions you ask it). No it's not magic, it's fucking retarded for everything it was not trained to do.
                    And even if it were, I don't want magic in my vacuum cleaner, I want silicon valley to shut up about AI for one second and leave us alone.
