            <b>The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy</b> is definetly one of the best books ever written, however it has nothing to do with anything discussed here.
            Or has it? Maybe it comes full circle and the humor of Douglas Adams circles back into my strange ideas about the world somehow.

            <h1>My current little theory of everything, supported by nothing and no one</h1>
            <p>
                I have one of those two, and starting with it feels fitting for this blog or whatever this even is supposed to be.
                Anyone who knows anything about physics knows that there is an odd ammount of perfection to everything. The universe is so
                perfect in fact, that something as complicated as time dilation can be proved with simple math and it works. This is an inherent beauty of our
                universe but it should make anyone suspicious. Meanwhile there are still parts of it we have yet to understand and I am sceptical we ever will.
                For example in a black hole or before the big bang all physics we know break down. On very small scales in the atoms the same thing happens,
                I haven't kept up with the latest string theory but for all I know they are still stuck. Some might call this our limited knowledge but
                for all we know it might just as well be god, the dude himself showing his fat ass in the cracks of his cage around us.
            </p>
            <p>
                But there is one more thing we have yet to understand, our own mind. Of course a system can never understand itself with a birdseye perspective,
                but there is still some parallell to be drawn here. My theory is that the universe exists solely in our heads, or a similarly structured system.
                This is because for one we really like rationality so it makes sense that whatever we might fantasise into existence is made up of math.
                But also that we are finding limits of it, a limited organism like a brain would show those cracks at some point.
                I also subscribe to the theory of egocentric presentism, which means that there is also only one of those systems that made up this
                entire escapade we call life. That would explain why reality is similar for every observer in it but egocentric presentism is a topic
                for another discussion.

            <h1>The meaning of all this</h1>
            Pretty deep shit we're in already.<br>
            <p>
                Some might say the meaning of everything is something stupid like reproduction or "finding happiness" whatever that even means.
                I don't like it when the answer is that simple, but neither do I agree with the fundamental idea.
            </p>
            <p>
                As far as I'm concerend there literally is none, judging by the absurdity of our situation,
                however much you ponder on it you wont get anywhere else no matter what tricks you try to pull to escape the existentialism.
                But there is one thing that humans have done since our dawn that might get pretty close, namely exploring the world around us.
                This also sounds pretty stupid as some answer to everything, but exploration is what has made us survive thus far so it makes sense
                for us to value it especially.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just look up at the sky, there you find the most beautiful shade of blue we will ever witness. The clouds possess the most intricate of shapes.
                Go to a forest, the trees are all beautiful with vibrant shades of green. The flowers shaded by them in vibrant colors.
                During winter the snow glimmers like gold in the low winter sun and looking closer you find natures most complex patterns in the palm of your hand
                in snowflakes. And staring up at a star filled night sky is a new experience each time, with the universe always in the mood to show you
                a new side of itself. Meanwhile in the deepest oceans lies places we can not even imagine from where we are right now.
                Exploring the paradise we are presented with is not just a temptation, nay, it is a challenge. And god damn it if it is the only
                thing we manage to do then let us find out what the surface of Mars <i>feels</i> like.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am not a fan of all the billionares racing against each other for being the first to find the last place in our solar system.
                If it is to be done it is to be done by a united effort where every last person is on board, because if this has anything to do
                with something materialistic then there is literally no point to any of it. I belive that space exploration and other lofty goals are
                equivalents to society's top layer on the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Only meaningful once all other layers are satisfied.
                But many people are in need of some goal to unify them, exploration and discovery is merely one of them.
                A goal for us all to rally around is important, but more important is that is does not come at expense of our freedom.

            <h1>The unavoidability of existence</h1>
            <p>
                One thing I have found that I have beef with is the people who are thankful for being born or something like that.
                This is stupid. One which has never been born is incapable of complaining about not existing. And one which is dead
                is incapable of complaining about being dead. This is not me being ungrateful for being alive, more just going with the flow.
                Existing sure is pretty nice but nobody would complain after the apocalypse has already happened would they.
                This ties in to the sentiment of thanking some higher power when something goes your way. Theres no shot that if god
                is sentient like us in some way, that he would give a flying fuck about whether you lost some football game or whatever
                first world problems people pray to god about nowadays. But one thing is for sure, god does not care if he created you or not.
                He probably has more important shit to do.
