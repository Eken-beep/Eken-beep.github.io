                Don't want to step on the toes of the actual tech category so this'll be less about tech itself and more about our interaction with it.

                <h2>Stupid fucking AI everywhere ruining everything</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some fuck in a marketing department (the lowest of human life, more comparable to the primates) put AI in everything and I'm sick of it.
                        Stop calling it AI first of all it is neither artificial nor intelligent. Well it is artificial in the sense of silicon.
                        But we didn't build the thing it's called machine learning for a reason so AI is actually kind of organic in a sense.
                        And AFAIK there is nothing even remotely intelligen about chat jippidy or it's little sibling clones that google and whomever else made.
                        What we have on our hands now is the worlds most expensive mansplainer eating up all the electricity from things actually useful to society.
                        I don't belive the AI doomers are anything but industry plants trying to make the AI hype even worse than it is. Or they are
                        just trying to distract us from the actual issue of this eating our precious resources for something so utterly useless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is reasonable that we want to antropromorphise something that is so similar to us in speech as a language model when we
                        do so to way less human like objects but damn I hate the fact that we do. But what is worse is the fact that it makes people
                        trust whatever chat jippidy says. The actual disinformation is spread by people trusting the trust-me-bro machine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there is something positive it would be that it hopefully takes the jobs of some paperturners somewhere. There is so much shit we do
                        that is fucking worthless, mainly everything that is even tangential to selling stuff to people. If an "AI" somewhere takes the job of some stupid
                        marketing guy I'd not shed a tear for him, he chose to be part of what ruins life for everybody so justice shall one day be served. Granted it's not
                        much better that a machine does the marketing stuff, perhaps even worse as we might be able to make some thing that is even more efficcient at selling
                        me crap than the current marketing people which is clearly the worst option possible. But more importantly machines might free up labour for actually
                        important jobs like healthcare or whatever else important with personnel shortages. In addition there are many people who seem to have as their life goal
                        to do fuck all. Not that I should judge wether or not what you do but at some point it gets stupid. You go to school with your parents money for way too
                        long and graduate to get some white collar job where you do about as much as in your school time just to go out partying all the time, might be healthy
                        for those to work an actual job some day even though I'd prefer that we all had to work less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, if an LLM in it's current state can do your job better than you then either you're absolutely worthless at what you do or your job should not
                        pay you in the first place.

            <h1>Perfectionism</h1>
                <p>
                    We always strive towards smoothing out every last irregularity in society.<br>
                    But what is there to grip on once we have created the flawless utopia?<br>
                    What injustice is there to judge our actions against once the last injustice has been erased?<br>
                    Will we inevitably fall into dystopia by creating a flawless world simply by sliding down the slippery slope?<br>
                    Of course i am not opposed to fighting against what you find is wrong, that is both positive and neccesary.
                    It is the people who think that everything will magically become better once this is reached who are delusional.
                    But that's all fine, even hoping to achive a society without injustice is futile as erasing one seems to just create more in many cases.
                    And possibly driving us into the gutter even further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One interesting extension of this I have come across is our seemingly endless search for the pure soul, the one which can do no wrong.
                    Can we never accept that no person will ever be perfect, not physically nor morally? Cancel culture is the epitamy of this.
                    To immediately dissmiss someone in their entirety based on one wrongdoing is utopian thinking at best and ignorance at worst.
                    Because we can not just expect the people who cancel others to never have done anything wrong on par with what they cancelled someone
                    else for. Shitting on cancel culture turned this into milquetoast real quickly so I'll stop here.

                    Advertising in it's current form might be one of the worst things we have created yet. It has gotten to a point where the internet is
                    completely unusable without using adblock (I'm hardly the first one to say so) and going to any public setting in densely populated areas
                    immediately gets you blasted with an infinite ammount of company messages all trying to do the same thing; convince you that you need their
                    worthless products and that you will forever be unhappy without them. The fact that you are trying so hard to get me to buy something I don't
                    need is absolutely disgusting and your attempts will only make me spite you more. But the thing I hate the most is that apparently it works
                    as two of the highest valued companies are entierly funded by such soulless advertments. And people go out shopping for stuff just for fun
                    or to kill time, this is probably the part of shopping that makes advertising as a business go round as I can't imagine any planned purchase
                    being significantly impacted by an ad you've seen.
                    Thus is my duty to avoid anything and everything with advertising on it if i can't block them.
