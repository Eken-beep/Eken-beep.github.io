                <h2>Stupid fucking AI everywhere ruining everything</h2>
                <p>
                    Some fuck in a marketing department (the lowest of human life, more comparable to the primates) put AI in everything and I'm sick of it.
                    Stop calling it AI first of all it is neither artificial nor intelligent. Well it is artificial in the sense of silicon.
                    But we didn't build the thing it's called machine learning for a reason so AI is actually kind of organic in a sense.
                    And AFAIK there is nothing even remotely intelligen about chat jippidy or it's little sibling clones that google and whomever else made.
                    What we have on our hands now is the worlds most expensive mansplainer eating up all the electricity from things actually useful to society.
                    I don't belive the AI doomers are anything but industry plants trying to make the AI hype even worse than it is. Or they are
                    just trying to distract us from the actual issue of this eating our precious resources for something so utterly useless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is reasonable that we want to antropromorphise something that is so similar to us in speech as a language model when we
                    do so to way less human like objects but damn I hate the fact that we do. But what is worse is the fact that it makes people
                    trust whatever chat jippidy says. The actual disinformation is spread by people trusting the trust-me-bro machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is something positive it would be that it hopefully takes the jobs of some paperturners somewhere. There is so much shit we do
                    that is fucking worthless, mainly everything that is even tangential to selling stuff to people. If an "AI" somewhere takes the job of some stupid
                    marketing guy I'd not shed a tear for him, he chose to be part of what ruins life for everybody so justice shall one day be served. Granted it's not
                    much better that a machine does the marketing stuff, perhaps even worse as we might be able to make some thing that is even more efficcient at selling
                    me crap than the current marketing people which is clearly the worst option possible. But more importantly machines might free up labour for actually
                    important jobs like healthcare or whatever else important with personnel shortages. In addition there are many people who seem to have as their life goal
                    to do fuck all. Not that I should judge wether or not what you do but at some point it gets stupid. You go to school with your parents money for way too
                    long and graduate to get some white collar job where you do about as much as in your school time just to go out partying all the time, might be healthy
                    for those to work an actual job some day even though I'd prefer that we all had to work less.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, if an LLM in it's current state can do your job better than you then either you're absolutely worthless at what you do or your job should not
                    pay you in the first place.
