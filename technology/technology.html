                <h1>My thoughts on the web as a whole and whatever this blog is supposed to be</h1>
                The entire fucking internet sucks right now, you know it. Everything is filled to the brim with ads and there is so much
                JavaScript complexity on any site that I have begun to always block JS unless I explicitly unblock it for certain sites.
                Just because some websites <i>can</i> use fancy dropdown menus and animated scrolling does not mean they should.
                There is something to be said for simplicity and this blog nobody will even find unless I send it to them is my quiet protest.
                Written in pure HTML/CSS, this blog is what I wish that most of the web was like. Not that no JS should be allowed, internet
                banks and shopping are pretty convenient and mostly better than the alternative. No the issue is things like Apple's website,
                A site requiring no fancy things at all except for the part where you buy something yet they insist on making my poor laptop
                burn to a crisp by loading megabytes of js for no particular purpouse. Lucky me I don't have any reason or desire to visit
                their site in the first place but they're far from the only or worst offender.
