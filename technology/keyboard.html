                <h1>To build a keyboard</h1>
                <h2>The problem with normal keyboards</h2>
                <p>
                    Soon after I had learnt to touch type started feeling the consequences of typing quickly.
                    I got pain in my wrists, by only typing very little because there are obviously people who type more than me and they're fine.
                    I might just be more susceptible to wrist injuries than others or something but I felt I had to do something about it.
                </p>
                <h2>Custom keyboard formfactors</h2>
                <p>
                    The first keyboard I built was a Corne-Cherry from a kit I bought online.
                    It included Glorious panda switches I lubed up myself as well as two pro-micro controllers.
                    While that keyboard was largely fine to type on, the switches were especially good compared to normal cherry reds.
                    I still felt part of the same issues as on the qwerty keyboard. Note here is that I used the dvorak layout on both.
                    The fact that it was a split keyboard definetly helped avoid the awkward angle you get on a normal keyboard and thumb keys
                    are great for speed. But the main issue is for one that it is so high so you get a different bend, this could be solved with
                    a simple wristrest but then I need to carry that around too. And in addition to that it still had too many keys on each finger
                    which leads to strain on weak fingers like the pinky
                </p>

                <h2>The final form</h2>
                <p>
                    After that partially failed venture I decided to go even smaller and built the tiny-18 which, descriptively, has 18 keys over 2
                    wireless halves. Built using a custom printed PCB from jlcpcb which I made in keycadand 2 nicenano controllers with one 100mAh battery each,                           that lasts me a couple of days per charge. The keys are also different, low profile khail choc v1 black keys this time. They're
                    super nice to type on, maybe a bit on the heavy side, should have gotten the 45g switches instead but oh well. I lubed those too
                    and did a tape mod, very time consuming but easy with so few keys and definetly worth it for the nice sound they have now.
                </p>

                <h3>The layout on this</h3>
                <p>
                    Of course the dvorak layout did not fit on an 18 key keyboard so you have to get a bit creative. I did not come up with the alpha-layers
                    myself but stole them from <a href="https://github.com/benvallack">Ben Vallack</a> which made a similar one with only 16 keys.
                    He is also where the idea came from. The tiny-18 uses the ISRT layout modified to include all the most common keys on the top alpha layer,
                    so not much.
                </p>

                You have to get creative with the keys so there are many functionalities on one key<br>
