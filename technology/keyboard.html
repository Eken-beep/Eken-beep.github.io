                <p>
                    I started out learning to touch type on a regular old qwerty-iso keyboard like any other sane human being
                    (I promise this is relevant for context). But being the idiot I am, soon after discovering that there are more layouts than
                    what is printed on the keycaps of the keyboard I decided to learn to type on a Dvorak keyboard instead. If I recall correctly
                    I reached the same speeds as on qwerty in a matter of weeks, this has definetly helped later on.
