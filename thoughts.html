            <h1>Ah yes I really feel like shitposting rn</h1>
            <p>
                I'm going to put the most retarded shit I can possibly make up here.
                Don't worry I've managed to convince myself of the stuff here but might change my mind at a whim. 
                The things here are not meant to be taken too seriously by others, I take them very seriously myself tho.
            </p>
            <p>
                A large part of the things here are just questions to myself, or an attempt at that. So I'll adress that first.
                Most questions posed might not have any good answers, that is fine to me. The point is not to come up with 42 and leave.
                The point is to be creative and critical to ourselves, maybe even improve some critical thinking. Many people dislike questions
                that don't have an answer, this is wrong for many reasons but I manly choose to view it as materialism. To never be satisfied
                without results you can touch is to never be satisfied in the first place if you extrapolate that to the extreme. It is fine
                to not be satisfied until some result is achived, but to judge the results like that is to limit yourself.
            </p>
